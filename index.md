# _Less Wrong_ sequences bundle (PDF)

Here you can find a PDF version of Eliezer Yudkowsky's
[_Less Wrong_ sequences][seq]. Not all sequences are included at the moment,
see below for the list. The code for generating this bundle is
[on GitHub][github].

## Download

The latest version of the sequences PDF is:

  * [2013-01-02][pdf] (3.9 MB, 926 pages)

(You may retrieve previous versions [here][pdf-history].)

## List of sequences

  * _Map and Territory_
  * _Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions_
  * _A Human's Guide to Words_
  * _How To Actually Change Your Mind_
  * _Reductionism_
  * _The Metaethics Sequence_

## Future work

Take a look at the [list of issues][issues], and the **_TODO_** items in
[lesswrong_book.py][pyfile].

Also, an ePub or MOBI version of this bundle could be generated from the
intermediate HTML output that the tool generates.

## Why?

While ePub and MOBI have certain clear advantages over PDF (mainly, the ability
to be read comfortably in devices of any size, e.g. mobile phones), they still
lag behind in what respects to annotations.

For this reason (rich annotations), I very much prefer PDF for my non-fiction
books.
