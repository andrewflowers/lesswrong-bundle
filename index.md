# _Less Wrong_ sequences bundle (PDF)

Here you can find PDF versions of Eliezer Yudkowsky's
[_Less Wrong_ sequences][seq]. Not all sequences are included at the
moment, see below for the list. The code for generating this bundle is
[on GitHub][github].

The nice thing about these PDFs is that allow you to navigate Eliezer's
back- and forward-references to other articles in the sequences, or in
other sequences. This is done in two ways:

  * the _screen_ version of the PDF assumes you're going to use a tablet
    or similar device to read it, and uses normal, blue links; external
    URLs are sign-posted appropriately.

  * the _paper_ version of the PDF assumes you're going to print it
    _(!)_, and uses footnotes to show both external and internal links
    (for external links it shows the URL, for internal links it shows
    the page and title of the article).

## Download

The latest version of the sequences PDF was generated on 2013-01-05:

  * screen version, [_lesswrong-seq.pdf_][pdf]
  * paper version, [_lesswrong-seq_paper.pdf_][pdf-paper]

## List of sequences

  * _Map and Territory_
  * _Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions_
  * _A Human's Guide to Words_
  * _How To Actually Change Your Mind_
  * _Reductionism_
  * _The Metaethics Sequence_

## Future work

Take a look at the [list of issues][issues], and the **_TODO_** items in
[lesswrong_book.py][pyfile].

Also, an ePub or MOBI version of this bundle could be generated from the
intermediate HTML output that the tool generates.

## Why?

While ePub and MOBI have certain clear advantages over PDF (mainly, the ability
to be read comfortably in devices of any size, e.g. mobile phones), they still
lag behind in what respects to annotations.

For this reason (rich annotations), I very much prefer PDF for my non-fiction
books.
